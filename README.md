- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ola
- ðŸ‘€ I love to build web applications to solve business problems

- I am a tech enthusiast! I love building and managing commercialisable tools and solutions such as websites and mobile apps. In the last 8 years, I've worked in different programming and non-programming roles in tech such as social media management, programmatic advertising, SEO, web analytics, web design (WordPress), web development (MERN stack) and graphics design. This is what I'm passionate about. ðŸ’ª
