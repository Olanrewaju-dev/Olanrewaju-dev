- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ola
- ðŸ‘€ I love to build web applications to solve business problems

- I am a tech enthusiast! I love building and managing commercialisable tools and solutions such as websites and mobile apps. In the last 5 years, I've worked in different non-programming roles in tech such as social media management, programmatic advertising, SEO, web analytics, web design (WordPress) and graphics design. Three years out of that time period, I discover and pursued my passion for software developer. My goal is to become a full stack Javascript developer ðŸ’ª.
